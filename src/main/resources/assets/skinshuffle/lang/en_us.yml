          Disable the toast that appears when you have switched skin preset during the cooldown period.
          
          The cooldown period exists due to caching issues related to the Mojang API. If you have switched skin preset during the cooldown period the toast will show - the server will not refresh your skin until the cooldown period is over.

          §o§7When you change your selected skin preset, SkinShuffle asks the server to refresh your skin for all players.
          §o§7The refresh might not occur instantly due to the cooldown period imposed by the caching issues of the Mojang API.
